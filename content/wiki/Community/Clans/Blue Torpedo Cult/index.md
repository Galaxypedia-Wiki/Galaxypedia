## Introduction

The **Blue Torpedo Cult** Is supposed to be a joke faction created for the "Blue Torpedo". It was founded on August 15, 2019,Â by the Founder, Frenzyy. Its current leader is Scrapduck14.

As of 12/11/19, the **Blue Torpedo Cult** expanded its faction both to Starscape and Galaxy, causing Frenzyy to be the overlord in the Starscape division.

The **Blue Torpedo Cult** was a group created by Frenzyy because of the meme that started on Galaxy Discord called the "Blue Torpedo", a torpedo remodel submission which was created by Shadow134574. The discord server went up to 20 members in less than an hour. There were debates on the discord server talking about how to get the blue torpedo added in, but sadly, Blue Torp didn't make it to the 2nd level of voting due to the sheer amount of dislikes. Later on, Sean added in [Blue Torp Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blue-Torp-Wasp) as a Limited time event ship that had two blue torpedoes mounted on the bottom. Everyone was happy.

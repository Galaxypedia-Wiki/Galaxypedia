# Galaxypedia-Hugo
This is the repository for the Galaxypedia rewrite in Hugo. The aim is to recreate the Galaxypedia using the Hugo static site generator while retaining familiar functionality as on the MediaWiki site.

## Morale
The Galaxypedia in its current uses the MediaWiki software as its basis. While very powerful, it's very expensive to run. It uses PHP and MySQL, which are very resource-intensive. MediaWiki is as heavy as it is powerful.

MediaWiki is also very complex. It relies heavily on templates, extensions, themes, and other customizations to make things run smoothly. This results in a huge codebase that is difficult to maintain.

Not only that, but MediaWiki is also very hard to update. It's not as simple as updating the software. You have to update the extensions, the themes, the database, the media, and everything else. Upgrading is essentially copying over old files to a new installation, which is really time consuming.

That's why we're looking into moving to a Hugo based Galaxypedia. This version is so light that it can be run using GitHub pages. It doesn't require comet or me to pay for a server. It doesn't need accounts, discussions, or anything extra and unnecessary. Every aspect of the site is made by us from ground up, so we can make it as simple or as complex as we want. As heavy or as lightweight as we want. We hope that a Hugo based Galaxypedia will be easier to maintain, update, and use. And will be made by us, for us.

## Will this replace the Galaxypedia?
It's complicated. The Hugo version of the Galaxypedia will be a separate entity from the MediaWiki version. The MediaWiki version will still be up and running for as long as the hugo version is in development. Once the Hugo version is ready, has most and/or all of the content and features of the MediaWiki version we will consider replacing the MediaWiki version with the Hugo version.

For now, it's up in the air.

## Contributing
### To the content
Contributing to the content is easy. If you want to make a change to an existing page, you can easily use the GitHub web editor, make your changes, and let it do the heavy work of forking and creating a pull request.

If you want to do anything more than that, and most likely you will, you'll need to set up a local development environment. This is easy to do, but in true Node.JS fashion, you'll need to install a bunch of stuff.

### To the platform
If you want to contribute to the platform, which means the site itself (styling, functionality, etc.),

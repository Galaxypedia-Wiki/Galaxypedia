If you find a security issue please let us know through the following public and/or private communication channels. Use the method you believe fits the vulnerability best.

### Public

### Private

- Emailing ketchup@smallketchup.ca

## What to supply us with

- A description of the vulnerability
- Estimated exposure
  - Is it something that might concern a user every now and then? every visit? if they perform a certain action?
  - How long you believe the vulnerability has existed in the codebase
- CVSS
  - Much like the above, it helps us get a bearing on the scale of the vulnerability
  - If the CVSS is high enough, we might be compelled to notify the userbase after fixing the vulnerability
- Reproduction steps

We take security issues seriously regardless of CVSS or metrics, and try to give our full attention to every report.
